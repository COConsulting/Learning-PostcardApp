# Learning-PostcardApp
This is an app I am developing during an iOS 8 class

The class is with bitfountain.io and all code and concepts are derived from their lessons. I may have enhanced the code with my own flavor, but basically the same. 

This public repository is for my teacher to check my code if needed.
